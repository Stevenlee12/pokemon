///  A URI is represented as a sequence of characters, not as a sequence of octets.
///  That is because URI might be "transported" by means that are not through a computer network, e.g.,
///  printed on paper, read over the radio, etc.

///  For original character sequences that contain non-ASCII characters, however, the situation is more difficult.
///  Internet protocols that transmit octet sequences intended to represent character sequences are expected to provide some way of
///  identifying the charset used, if there might be more than one [RFC2277].
///  However, there is currently no provision within the generic URI syntax to accomplish this identification.
///  An individual URI scheme may require a single charset, define a default charset, or provide a way to indicate the charset used.
///
///  In the IOS SDK we have the following:

///  User: URLUserAllowedCharacterSet
///  Password: URLPasswordAllowedCharacterSet
///  Host: URLHostAllowedCharacterSet
///  Path: URLPathAllowedCharacterSet
///  Fragment: URLFragmentAllowedCharacterSet
///  Query: URLQueryAllowedCharacterSet
///  You can use addingPercentEncoding(withAllowedCharacters:) to encode a string correctly.
